# Title 1

## Quarto

Hi Quarto!
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## More code

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(magrittr)
lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

## Highlight Specific Lines of Code

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|3"
a <- 1
b <- 1
a + b
```

## Code Annotation

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(beepr)
beep() # <1>
# a comment # <2>
```

1. Here we can explain what that line of code is doing.
2. Here we can explain that the second line is just a comment.

## Math

We can add a centered equation

$$x+7\beta$$

or left aligned:

$x+7 +\mu$


## Figure

We can add an a figure with a caption and an alternate text

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 20%
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: This is the figure caption
#| fig-alt: A round logo that reads Stats 67 with an anteater in the background 
knitr::include_graphics('logo.png')
```

## Incremental Text

To display text incrementally, three dots with spaces can be used on a new line . . .

. . .

By default, qmd displays bullet points and enumerated text (i.e., lists) incrementally, this can ben changed in the YAML (top) section of the document by setting `incremental: false`.

. . .

Or it can be turned off for a specific part of the document

::: nonincremental
-   1st Item
-   2nd Item
:::

## Divide slide into columns

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Left column
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Right column
:::
:::

## Code and Output in Two Columns

```{r}
#| output-location: column
summary(mtcars)
```


## Code and Output in Separate Slides

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
summary(mtcars)
```
