## Random process

In random processes there is more than one possible outcome and the deterministic prediction of the outcome is difficult.

e.g. flip of a coin  
e.g. roll of a die




## Sample Space

**Sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process.

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Examples

In a single roll of a die:

$S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

In flipping a single coin twice:

$S = \{ HH, TT, HT, TH\}$

```{r fig.align='right', out.width="10%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/04/03/00/37/die-308887_960_720.png")

```


## Event

An __event__ is a subset of the sample space.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Examples

Let A represent the event that a single roll die results in an **even** number.

$A = \{2, 4, 6 \}$


Let B represent the event that a single roll die results in an **odd** number.

$B = \{1, 3, 5 \}$


Let C represent the event that a single roll die results in a **prime** number.

$C = \{2, 3, 5 \}$

```


## Complement of an Event


**Definition** Complement of an event is the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are not in the event itself.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Example

Complement of event $C$ is the set of outcomes in a roll die that are not prime.

**Notation** $C^c$

**Pronunciation** C complement

$C^c = \{1, 4, 6\}$

:::



## Mutually Exclusive or Disjoint Events



**Definition** Mutually exclusive or disjoint events are two events that cannot happen at the same time.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Examples

Events A and B are mutually exclusive because an outcome of a roll of a die cannot be even *and* odd.

Events A and C are *not* mutually exclusive because 2 is both an even number and a prime number so event A and C can happen simultaneously.

## Events and Set Notation

<div align ="center">

```{r echo = FALSE}

set_table <- data.frame(Description = c("Union", "Intersection"),
                        Notation = c("\\(A \\cup C\\)", 
                                   "\\(A \\cap C\\)"),
                        Reading = c("A or C", "A and C"),
                        Elements = c("{2, 3, 4, 5, 6}",
                        "{2}"))



kableExtra::kable(set_table, "html", escape = FALSE)

``` 

</div>


## Defining Probability

**Frequentist definition**

The probability of an outcome is defined to be the proportion of times the outcome is observed under high number of repetitions of the random process.


##

Assume that we are repeating the random process of a coin flip and are recording $X$, the number of heads in $n$ coin flips. Then

$$P(H) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{X}{n}$$

$$P(H) =\frac{1}{2}$$

## Defining Probability


**Bayesian definition**

When defining probability in addition to considering number of times an outcome occurs, Bayesians consider prior information that they have about an outcome. 

More on this in Stats 115.


## Axioms of Probability


1) The probability of any event is between zero and one:

. . .

$$0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$$

. . .

2) The probabilities must add up to 1.

. . .

$$P(S) = 1$$

##

3) The probability of mutually exclusive events is additive. 

. . .

$$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} A_{i} = \Sigma_{i =1}^\infty P(A_i)$$


## Probability of Complementary Events

$P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Example

If we know the the probability that somebody owns a bike is 0.08, then we would know that the probability that somebody does not own a bike is 0.92.

:::


## Independence and Multiplication Rule

Two processes are independent if knowing about the outcome of one does not help predict the outcome of the other. 

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Example

two flips of a single coin

:::

## 

If events A and B are from two independent processes, then

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

. . .

Probability of getting two heads in two flips of a single coin is

$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

## Data - GSS 2018

The General Social Survey (GSS) is a sociological survey that has been regularly conducted since 1972. It is a comprehensive survey that provides information on experiences of residents of the United States.

## Events

Let B represent an event that a randomly selected person in this sample believes in life after death.

. . .

Let C represent an event that a randomly selected person in this sample took a college level science course. 


## Joint Probability

Note that events $B$ and $C$ are not mutually exclusive. A randomly selected person can believe in life after death and might have taken a college science course. $B \cap C \neq \emptyset$.

. . .

$P(B \cap C) = \frac{375}{1050}$

. . .

Note that $P(B\cap C) = P(C\cap B)$. Order does _not_ matter.


## Marginal Probability


$P(B)$ represents a __marginal probability__. So do $P(C)$, $P(B^C)$ and $P(C^C)$. In order to calculate these probabilities we could only use the values in the margins of the contingency table, hence the name. 

$P(B) = \frac{860}{1050}$  
$P(C) = \frac{450}{1050}$


## Conditional Probability


$P(B|C)$ represents a __conditional probability__. So do $P(B^c|C)$, $P(C| B)$ and $P(C|B^c)$. To calculate the probabilities we focus on the row or the column of the given information. We _reduce_ the sample space to this given information. 

. . .

Probability that a randomly selected person believes in life after death given that they have taken a college science course  
$P(B|C) = \frac{375}{450}$



## Conditional Probability

The order matters!

$P(\text{has a dog | like dogs}) \neq$ $P(\text{like dogs | has a dog})$


## Addition Rule



$P(B\cup C) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B \cap C)$

. . .

$P(B\cup C) = \frac{860}{1050} + \frac{450}{1050} -\frac{375}{1050} = \frac{935}{1050}$

. . .

$P(B\cup C) = \frac{375}{1050} + \frac{75}{1050} +\frac{485}{1050} = \frac{935}{1050}$
