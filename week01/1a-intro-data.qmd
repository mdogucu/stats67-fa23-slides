## Object assignment operator

```{r}
birth_year <- 1950
```


. . .

|                            | Windows        | Mac              |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Shortcut     | Alt + -        | Option + -       |


## R is case-sensitive


```{r error=TRUE}

my_age <- 2020 - birth_year

My_age
```

##

If something comes in quotes, it is not defined in R. 


```{r}

ages <- c(25, my_age, 32)

names <- c("Menglin", "Mine", "Rafael")

data.frame(age = ages, name = names)
```


## Vocabulary

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the argument of the function.

. . .

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something, colorful)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the first argument of the function;   
`colorful` is the second argument of the function.



## Getting Help

In order to get any help we can use `?` followed by function (or object) name. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
?c
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r eval = FALSE}
age <- c(6, 9, 15)

data.frame(age_kid = age)
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- After function names do not leave any spaces.

- Before and after operators (e.g. <-, =) leave spaces. 

- Put a space after a comma, **not** before. 

- Object names are all lower case, with words separated by an underscore.

# Getting to Know Data

[Dear Mona, Which State Has the Worst Drivers?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/)

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
data("bad_drivers")
```

## Data Matrices  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/data-matrix.png')
knitr::include_graphics('img/data-matrix-tail.png')
```

## Data Matrices

- The data matrix has `r ncol(bad_drivers)` __variables__ (state, num_drivers, perc_speeding, perc_not_distracted, perc_no_previous, insurance_premiums, losses). 

- The data matrix has `r nrow(bad_drivers)` __cases__ or __observations__. Each case represents a US state (or District of Columbia). 

## Data documentation

```

`state` State

`num_drivers` Number of drivers involved in fatal collisions per billion miles

`perc_speeding` Percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who were speeding
